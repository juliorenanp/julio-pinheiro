        <p>
          Hi, I'm Julio Pinheiro and I live in São Paulo, Brazil. I've been a
          software developer for the past nine years! I've been working in
          several business segments and with very cool and interesting
          technologies. I learned a lot during my career, and what I value the
          most is understanding the real needs of the clients/business. I also
          had the great opportunity to lead teams during some projects,
          understanding the profiles of each one, and feedback techniques. I
          really enjoy teaching, especially to people new to the area, I had
          several nice opportunities in this regard. I also like to learn from
          the team and keep the team engaged.
